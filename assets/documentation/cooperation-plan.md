  - Open communication
  - Offer support

  - Focus on MVP and 80% test coverage
  - Reevaluate necessity of features
  - Get TA/Instructor help/direction

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

1. How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
  - Open communication, deciding tasks based on UML/big picture, and time commitment of feature tasks

2. What project management tool will be used?
  - Github projects
  
## Presentation Deck

Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

Link to the shared doc in your project plan.

1. Schedule your practice session
2. Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”
